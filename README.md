### UI Description:
The UI to be implemented resembles a table structure. Each row represents a state, with the first column dedicated to product filters and the subsequent columns representing design variants

### Key Features:
1. Add/Delete a State:
Implement functionality to dynamically add and remove states (rows) in the table.

2. Add/Delete Variant Columns:
Implement functionality to dynamically add and remove variant columns in the table.

3. Row Reordering:
Allow users to reorder the state rows using drag-and-drop functionality.

4. Design Insertion (Optional):
Allow users to insert a design into a specific variant column.

5. Eye for perfection : If the number of variants added become more than 4 then it should have a scroll as shown in the video, Thinking out of the box is also welcome 



### Tech Stack:
- Next.js: A React framework for building the UI and handling server-side rendering.
- React DnD: For implementing drag-and-drop functionality.
- CSS Library: Any CSS framework can be used to style the UI, offering flexibility.
