Project Name: RetainIQ Next.js Assignment

Project Overview:
This project involves creating a user interface (UI) using React (with Next.js), based on a video demonstration. The UI includes a table structure with dynamic rows and columns, representing different states and design variants. Key functionalities include:

- Adding/Deleting states and variant columns.
- Reordering rows via drag-and-drop.
- Conditional scrolling for tables with more than 4 variants.

Key Features:
- Dynamic Rows and Columns: Add or remove table rows and columns dynamically.
- Drag-and-Drop: Rows can be reordered using a drag-and-drop interface.
- Conditional Scrolling: Automatic scrolling when there are more than 4 columns.
- Clean Code: The project follows clean and well-documented coding practices.

Tech Stack:
- Next.js: A React framework for building the UI and handling server-side rendering.
- React DnD: For implementing drag-and-drop functionality.
- CSS Library: Any CSS framework can be used to style the UI, offering flexibility.
